<h3> Quick Background </h3>
<p>
I had made an earlier <a href="http://www.blog.fzakaria.com/2011/03/hypemachine-cocoa-woes/">post</a> regarding how specifically I have been having trouble porting over my python hypemachine script into Objective-C. Being new to Objective-C and Cocoa development specifically I wasn't sure whether I was doing something <del datetime="2011-03-30T16:32:20+00:00">stupidly</del> wrong or that the <a href="www.hypem.com">hypemachine</a> guys were doing something to thwart my pet project. Turns out it was the latter, so with a new resolve to figure out the web I moved on!</p>
<h3>Hello Wireshark</h3>
<p>
As mentioned many times already, I <em>rarely</em> do web development or anything involving networks. Therefore figuring out what was happening was a great way to get some new exposure to some tools and re-familiarize myself with how things are done. (It's been a while since my networks course). A good place to start I knew was to inspect the TCP/IP packets using <a href="http://www.wireshark.org/">Wireshark</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>Wireshark is a network protocol analyzer. It lets you capture and interactively browse the traffic running on a computer network.</p></blockquote>
<p>
With Wireshark all setup, I began to inspect the HTTP packets. Knowing that obviously requests through the browser work and those from my python script work I stored the HTTPHeaders of all 3 to scan for differences.</p>
<p><code><br />
~Python~<br />
Severity level : chat<br />
Group: Sequence<br />
Request Method: GET<br />
Request Version: HTTP/1.1<br />
Accept-Encoding: identity<br />

<p>~Chrome Browser~<br />

</code></p>
<p>
At first I thought it must've been the <strong>User-Agent </strong>however changing that to be that of a web-browser accomplished nothing. The only real difference happened to be the <strong>Cookie</strong> field. Sure enough, removing the cookie from the Cocoa request caused the site to start returning me <em>valid</em> keys!</p>
<h2> Grabbing that Sweet Sweet Music </h2>
<h3> Attempt 1 </h3>
<p>
Now that I can successfully grab the proper keys, I began to attempt to use <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/cocoa/reference/Foundation/Classes/NSURLDownload_Class/Reference/Reference.html">NSURLDownload</a> to try to download the song. <em>It did not happen to be so easy however...</em></p>
<p>
Turns out that the site is performing many redirects to <a href="http://soundcloud.com/">soundcloud</a> and although NSURLDownload follows the redirects appropriately, when the time comes to attempt to write the data to disk it fails with an error "NSURLError Domain 3001".</p>
<blockquote><p>It's a shame I couldn't figure out how to solve the problem for NSURLDownload because it affords me asynchronous downloading and writing to file together. If someone knows what I may be doing incorrectly please let me know.</p></blockquote>
<p>All that was needed was a switch to NSURLConnection instead (performing it synchronously currently) and I was able to grab the data!</p>
<pre class="brush:cpp">
       //lets choose where we'd like to store our song
        NSURL * directory = [self getDownloadDirectory];
       //lets choose the savingURL to be the songname at the chosen directory
	NSURL * savingURL = [NSURL URLWithString:[song mp3Name] relativeToURL:directory];
       //create the request using: 'http://hypem.com/serve/play/&rsquo; + id + &lsquo;/&rsquo; + key + &lsquo;.mp3&prime;
        NSMutableURLRequest * songRequest = [NSMutableURLRequest requestWithURL:[song songUrl] ];
       //grab the data (synchronously currently...) 
        NSData * songData = [NSURLConnection sendSynchronousRequest:songRequest returningResponse:nil error:nil];
       //write to file
        if (songData)
        {
            [songData writeToURL:savingURL atomically:YES];
        }
</pre>
<p><strong>Successs!</strong> I was properly creating a file to disk, not getting any errors...<em>however</em> the file size was 0!</p>
<h3> Redo Attempt 1 </h3>
<p>
I got to the point where  I can make the GET request for the song however there was <strong>one</strong> final piece of the puzzle missing. Ultimately, I had solved the similar problem in my python script. I had to set the <em>Cookie</em> in the download GET request to the cookie received from the response of the initial request of grabbing the HTML file.</p>
<p><code><br />
Set-Cookie: "AUTH=03%3A430aaa119c1852924ef832bbaf5fa989%3A1301502627%3A2170648814%3AON-CA; expires=Fri, 26-Mar-2027 16:30:27 GMT; path=/; domain=hypem.com"<br />
</code></p>
<p>Setting the <em>Cookie</em> value to the one initially retrieved solved the problem and the music started to flow!<br />
The missing line to the code above is the following right after the request is created:</p>
<pre class="brush:cpp">
 [songRequest setValue:[hypeController cookie] forHTTPHeaderField:@"Cookie"];
</pre>
<h2> Cute Easter Egg </h2>
<p>
What was amusing was that while inspecting the packets of those sent/received from <a href="hypem.com">HypeMachine</a> I noticed an easter egg embedded inside. Here is one of the HTTPHeader fields given in the response packet given back by the site:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>X-hacker</strong>: Hey, if you're reading this, you should drop us an email at hypem.com/contact, maybe we can work together!rn</p></blockquote>
