    Thanks tyler!
    If you're any good at graphic design or CSS let me know! I'm looking for contributors for that so that I can potentially re-launch it on Google Chrome Store. (I'll need to remove HypeMachine all affiliation such as pics)

    I've actually been using HypeMachine a bit recently however it's been largely di.fm, Soundcloud and buying individual songs from Beatport.
    I've started re-using HypeMachine now that I can search by tags though :)

    Thank you for this plug-in. It is making my life much easier.

    I do not much about coding and such, but is it possible to change the quality of the tracks downloaded from Hypem? The bit rate of the songs is 128kbps, which is pretty low.

  content: "Here is some information I found: \n\"Hype Machine caches copies of files
    available on blogs on their own server. It transcodes high bitrate files so sometimes
    the original files are available at a higher bitrate on the original blog (example:
    128kbps via the download link but the original blog will have 256kbps versions)\""

    (when copying the downloaded files to itunes the title and artist is not separated
    eg it appears like this \"BANKS - WAITING GAME (Prod. By SOHN)\" all under the
    \"Name\" tab in itunes.\n\n2. Higher bitrate downloads if possible.\n\nOther than
    that, thank you so much!"

  content: The specialist that I would love to have an<a href="http://lwuulsiv.com"
    rel="nofollow"> otunrtpoipy</a> to work with is a Neonatologist. I think that
    it would be a blessing and a miracle to be able to work with little ones that
    have to rely on you during their first few weeks of life. Some infants may require
    extra attention and treatment for various reasons. Being able to show empathy
    and give support to the families during the process is essential. My daughter
    was six weeks premature and required extra treatment, so I can understand the
    feeling that parents have when they can't leave the hospital with their little
    miracle. Being able to now be the one to give that support to the families and
    making them feel as comfortable as they can be knowing that their child is receiving
    the best care possible is really important to me. New parents may feel overwhelmed
    and may not know how to do certain things, so being able to assist in showing
    them how to care for their little one would be an amazing experience.The specialists
    that I would least want to work with would be an Emergency physician and a Proctologist.
    Working with an emergency physician, you would never know what you can encounter
    any given day. I feel that I can handle a lot with respect to blood or anything
    that could make a person queasy, but I don't know how I would react if a patient
    came in with a severed limb or just anything that is extreme and out of the ordinary.
    As with a Proctologist, I don't have an interest working with a specialist that
    deals with disorders of the colon, rectum, and anus. With both of these specialties,
    it may be because neither are areas that I would explore. I'm sure with proper
    training you will be more knowledgeable and see the importance and necessity of
    having a specialist that can provide care for patients that depend on them to
    make them feel better.At the end of the day though, you have to love what you
    do no matter which area of interest you choose.

  content: Since there is so many fields of<a href="http://mcpemd.com" rel="nofollow">
    sceeialtips</a> that I have a choice of, I still really can't choose one.  So
    I am going base on my personal experiences.  My original goal back in high school
    and maybe even before that, was to work in a Neonatal ICU!  I had a brother that
    passed before he had his first birthday from heart complications, and that year
    I spent a lot of time at hospitals with my parents.   My goal the first couple
    of years was to work with babies just like him.   That was until I had my own
    children,  I would of still loved to have worked in that career field but the
    heart ache I would most likely endure when one of those babies did not make it
    home.  I could not have handled!On to more positive experiences, I have worked
    with the elderly and Geriatrics interests me very much.  Being surrounded with
    people that have lived a fulfilled life is so much more rewarding.  Even though
    at times it is the ending stages of their lives,  and it is sad when someone does
    pass.  It's less of a heartache to know that most of the time they are ready to
    move on.   They are still very dependent on you and when you are able to help
    them with their needs that's the most rewarding of all, plus you form a special
    relationship with the patients and their families.

<h2> I'm still kicking </h2>
<blockquote><p><strong>tl;dr;</strong> You can get the latest and greatest of the Chrome HypeMachine Download Extension on my <a href="https://github.com/fzakaria/HypeMachine-Extension">Github Account</a>. </p></blockquote>
<p>
I hope everyone hasn't written me off as dead since the <em>somewhat</em> shutdown of <a href="http://metahypem.com">MetaHypem</a>. I've been trying to think of a new project and devoting to more time to my professional life (i.e. working at Amazon). I have however not forgotten about all of you and your insatiable desire for music.</p>
<p>
I recently received a <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests">Pull-Request</a> that detailed some changes I've been planning to make for quite a while! (props to <a href="https://github.com/landr0id">landr0id</a>). The changes outlined: </p>
<ol>
<li>changing to HypeMachine's new private API (which I've detailed <a href="http://blog.fzakaria.com/2012/10/hypem-api-changes/">earlier</a>)</li>
<li>adding the new <em>sexy</em> <a href="http://davidwalsh.name/download-attribute">HTML5 download attribute</a></li>
<li>Downloaded songs are now named according to artist and title</li>
<li>general performance improvements</li>
</ol>
<p><h3> What does this mean for you? </h3>
<p>The extension is still alive and well. You can even now <strong>Left Click</strong> on the download arrow to kickoff the download. Goodbye confusing <em>Save As...</em> instructions!</p>
