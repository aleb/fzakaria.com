  content: As an avid reader of your blog, I'm sorry to say that you don't have a
    leg to stand on here. You purposefully abused his service, even when he tried
    to stop you, and you published extensions that made abusing his service easy and
    automatic. The fact that after the fact you retracted the pre-packaged version
    from the Chrome Web Store doesn't absolve you of your original abuses.

  content: "<a href=\"#comment-3192\" rel=\"nofollow\">@Garret Kelly:</a> \n\nWouldn't
    allowing me to use the API restrict me to how they deem the service should be
    used?\nI only did the Extension, script etc.. because at the time there was no
    API?\n\nAn API helps keep people in the sandbox of your choosing?"

  content: "<a href=\"#comment-3193\" rel=\"nofollow\">@Farid Zakaria:</a> \n\nYes
    to all of the things you've said in this reply. _However_, you're being punished
    now because you abused their service when there wasn't an API. Other people waited
    for the API, but you didn't. You wasted their time--time they could have spent
    literally any way they wanted, had you not interfered.\n\nJust because you want
    to play nice _now_ does not entitle you to a free pass."

  content: "<a href=\"#comment-3194\" rel=\"nofollow\">@Garret Kelly:</a> \n\nYou
    make it sound as if I was too much of a villain. I exposed the REST calls before
    an API was developed and once asked (after a few rounds of e-mail exchanges) eventually
    took down whatever I developed. That sounds pretty nice ;)\n\nI always thought
    our e-mail exchanges were nice and polite and ripe with discussion.\n\nIn one
    e-mail exchange they mention the reason for rejection that I don't share their
    ideology of delivering media. I always thought our discussion regarding that was
    interesting. I was of the idea that their restriction of the media to their site
    goes against what the artist is trying to accomplish by releasing the track via
    the internet."

  content: I have 2 independent ideas  First   imeepmlnt markermanager, it's not difficult.
    But when I've finished development for Zh YandexMap, I think, that this functionality
    in Google is done, but .You can see demo from my demo site for Yandex component
    (first menu item =  How to find )You can click left items, and enable|disable
    group of markers.I've an idea how I can do this, but first   pure marker manager

<h2> The Spark </h2>
<p>
I've been doing a lot of work (developing multimedia device driver) for Windows 8 for my current job. As such, I had to watch and listen to a bunch of talks about Windows 8 new <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqSNuLsLJR4">Metro style applications</a> and thought it would be a pretty neat area to play around in.</p>
<blockquote><p>
Windows 8 introduces a new Metro style interface, which shows the information important to you, embodies simplicity, and gives you control. The interface is a personalized layout with clean typography and animations to make interacting with your PC fluid and intuitive.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
What's really cool is that to build a Metro Application, you make use of the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/hh464942.aspx">WindowsRT </a>(windows Runtime) API. The best part is that the API is available in <strong>multiple </strong>languages including JavaScript, C++, C# and VB</p>
<p>
Since I always seem to use HypeMachine as my guinea pig for learning new technologies, <em>I figured why stop now...</em></p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<h2> Private API </h2>
<p>
I have known for a while that HypeMachine was providing certain people access to their private API. However I just noticed recently that they've been advertising it.<br />
<a href="http://fzakaria-blog.elasticbeanstalk.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/hypem_dev_access.png"><img src="http://fzakaria-blog.elasticbeanstalk.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/hypem_dev_access.png" alt="" title="HypeMachine Developer API Access" width="277" height="116" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-956" style="border:1px solid black"  /></a></p>
<p>I decided to ask for access thinking that in my opinion, my previous relationship with them had been <a href="http://www.blog.fzakaria.com/2011/07/removed-hypemachine-chrome-extension/">generous and polite</a>, explaining in my e-mail that I planned on using the API <strong>solely</strong> for my personal Windows 8 project. </p>
<p>
<em>With high spirits, I waited for the response...</em></p>
<h2> Rejection </h2>
<p>
Ultimately I received an e-mail back from HypeMachine explaining that they are <strong>rejecting</strong> my request to be included in the private API because I have been "difficult to work with in the past" and that "we do not have the resources for it". At the end of the day, it is their sole discretion and right to grant access to whoever they'd like to their private API, however I was hoping that  due to my previous relationship (I removed both the Batch-Downloader and Chrome Extension when asked) that I wouldn't be seen as being difficult to work with.</p>
<p>I guess back to <em>hacking </em>it....</p>
