<h2> A Child's <del datetime="2012-05-11T14:44:00+00:00">Creeper</del> Creper </h2>
<p>
I carpool. In fact I carpool a lot. I carpool 3 people back and forth on my daily work commute. Carpooling has never rewarded me back as nicely as it has with the drawing below.</p>
<div>
<a href="http://fzakaria-blog.elasticbeanstalk.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_20120317_210511.jpg"><img src="http://fzakaria-blog.elasticbeanstalk.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_20120317_210511.jpg" alt="" title="Minecraft Creeper" width="500" height="700" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1082" /></a>

The painting above was done by the son of one of the guys I carpool to work. I had caught this masterpiece while inebriated during this year's St. Patty's Day celebrations at his home (he held a little shindig). I paid my friend $100 for his child's painting and never looked back.</p>
<blockquote><p>His son is around 6 years old. Doesn't it just warm your nerdy little heart to see this image? </p></blockquote>
