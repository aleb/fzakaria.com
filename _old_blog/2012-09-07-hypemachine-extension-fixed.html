    <a href="#comment-4632" rel="nofollow">@Andrew:</a> Can you email me a photo of what you are seeing?
    Did you re-download the latest files from GitHub?

    I just did a fresh install (downloaded fresh from GitHub and installed the extension) and it works.
    Albeit, you won't see a full arrow (I need someone to help me fix that) but you will see a clickable half arrow thingy next to the play button!

<h2>Sorry it took so long...</h2>
<p>
While I was away on vacation in Turkey (will post photos later), HypeMachine and Chrome decided to both muck up my <a href="https://github.com/fzakaria/HypeMachine-Extension">extension</a>. This is a short blog post to inform everyone that the code found on GitHub is now fixed and working again. <em>Hurray!</em></p>
<blockquote><p>Please go to  <a href="https://github.com/fzakaria/HypeMachine-Extension">https://github.com/fzakaria/HypeMachine-Extension</a> to get the latest Chrome Extension.</p></blockquote>
<h2> Call to arms</h2>
<p>
What I was <strong>not able to fix</strong> however is the nifty/spiffy look of the downward arrow button. I'd love if someone can please contribute to the project and fix the arrow. I liked the original implementation of it being done in pure CSS as it blended in beautifully with the Hypem page. Please either contact me or submit a patch to the GitHub repository!</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<h2>The fix</h2>
<p>
The fix for the problems were rather straightforward and entailed the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Updating the manifest.json for Chrome Extension to version 2. </li>
<li>Updating the tracks variable (that is read when injected) to the new variable name of <em>window.displayList['tracks']</em></li>
</ol>
