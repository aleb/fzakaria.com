    I didn't really include a manual so here is a quick one:
    1 - You can change the url in the top right. Just change 'popular' to things such as 'latest' or even any username!
    2- The button to the top right lets you chose the save location. By default it's where the application has launched from.
    3- More scrapes more songs!
    4- Refresh, restarts the page number 1 and refreshes.
    5- Download, downloads. Simple!

    Hi,

    Fantastic work on the downloader - it all works just fine - apart from one thing...

    Does the green song title mean the song(s) have downloaded? The ones that remain black in the list have not downloaded, and don't seem to download at all..

    Should I just leave it on over night and see what happens? Or is this a bug.. I'm downloading 350 songs from my Hypem.

    Cheers!

    <a href="#comment-1762" rel="nofollow">@Drew:</a>  Hey Drew,

    A green song title means the song(s) have been ownloaded and the ones that remain black mean they haven't.

    I wrote this application not with the use case in mind that someone would be downloading in bulk 350 songs so that it might actually crash if you do because I think I made each download it's own thread asynchronously.

    If that's the use case, I might put it on one thread now instead.... interesting...

  content: "Hi Farid, \nI agree with Drew. I'm trying to download quite a few song
    and though it's not crashing the program, it only was able to get through about
    half and it gave up on the others. I am able to go back and select the ones that
    weren't download it an do it again, but like you said it would be nice to have
    it queued in some way. I definitely agree some sort of progress indicator would
    be nice! I think the biggest use case would be to do a batch download of your
    entire favorites library. Maybe there's a button that can just queue up all the
    songs from favorite list instead of having to press \"more\" a bunch of times.\n\nMost
    needed bug fixes:\n1. Fix apostrophes to display without \"\"\n2. The ID3 tag
    should include artist. Right now it only has song name. Or even the file itself
    could have artist name.\n\nIt'd love to check out the code if you put it on GitHub.
    My user name is neufuture there. Awesome work, btw."

    \n\nYea it was an error in how I programmed it.. for some reason I put each song
    it's own thread rather than have all the songs download together just on a seperate
    thread. I'll work on it this week (haven't looked at it recently) and put the
    new code as well on GitHub.\n\n\nI have a batch python script for doing more of
    the 'download all' type of songs if you want.\nI envisioned this for more selectively
    choosing songs."

    each song, and i realized that each file was only \"526 bytes.\" do you have a
    solution to this problem? it was the same issue with the chrome extension with
    only the links to the song being downloaded. \n\ni'd greatly appreciate any feedback.\n\nkevin"

    I just noticed that Anthony (Hypemachine's developer) has recently a pushed a change to the site on the way they deliver their music content. As such my Chrome extension was broken. I filled myself a bug report on my GitHub (https://github.com/fzakaria/HypeMachine-Extension/issues/4).

    I plan on fixing the application and the extension this week.

    Farid,

    Awesome work! There are several songs that would immediately "cancel" itself after i click download. There is also another set of songs that will download and finish right after with 1kb.  I've tried exiting the program and restarting several times and it doesn't seem to fix it. It does the job for most of my other songs so I'm still really grateful :)  Looking forward to your future work :)

    Hey!

    All the HypeMachine projects can be found on my GitHub. You can find the java code specifically <a href="https://github.com/fzakaria/HypeMachine-Java" rel="nofollow">here</a>.
    Have you checked out my recent pet project with my friend Alex? We've built a site that lets you easily download and stream the music from Hypemachine.
    Check it out at <a href="http://metahypem.com" rel="nofollow">http://metahypem.com</a>.

    The site is built responsive so it should look decent on a mobile browser and let you download and play the songs on your android phone!

    Thanks for the reply!

    Is your Java code up to date?
    In your article "Hypem API Changes" (Published:October 2, 2012) you fix the workaround.
    Had this been implemented in your Java project?
    According to Github the project was last authored 3 months ago, which leads me to believe it might need a little update.

    I checked out http://metahypem.com. It's great for constant desktop (in fact I'm using it right now) use and possibly sporadic mobile use, but I don't see it replacing a dedicated music player (that listens to (bluetooth) media key events, has a shuffle function, auto start next song, downloads and plays simultaneously etc.)

    I'd like to start on that dedicated music player :)

<blockquote>UPDATE - May 24 2011: I had fixed a few issues with the batch downloader such as having it download to the proper directory and made it a bit more easier to use.</p></blockquote>
<h2> It's Been A While </h2>
<p>
For starters, I've officially graduated from the University of Waterloo's <a href="http://www.softeng.uwaterloo.ca/">Software Engineering program</a>. <em>Yay!</em> However what has seem an eternity ago (~2 months) I haven't touched my computer in any way resembling programming. Just recently, the <del datetime="2011-05-20T01:55:01+00:00">evil geniuses</del> wonderful guys at <a href="http://hypem.com/">HypeMachine</a> decided to <strong>break</strong> my sweet <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/imbbbpnnjeljfopnjohfoieconfedbhh">Chrome Extension</a>. Before tackling the task of trying to now fix it, I thought I'd start off small and re-acquaint myself with some easy programming. For some reason, I chose Java....</p>
<h2> I'm not sure why I chose Java </h2>
<p>
In all honesty, I haven't programmed in Java since first/second year at UW. However, I figured what the hell and tried to write a GUI for my Python Batch Downloader Script which I get e-mails regarding constantly. I always seem to get <strong>stuck</strong> on the design aspect of any programming which is frustrating. Whereas the means to download and scrape the information is quick and easy, I am finding the ability to make a flawless User Interface and perhaps have it run super smooth with ThreadPools a bit more aggravating.<br />
Anyways, I think I've toyed enough with it to release a 0.1<em>Alpha</em>. Here it is if people want to play around with it and let me know how I've mucked up.</p>

<h3> Things I already Know I'd Like To Fix </h3>
<ol>
<li><del datetime="2011-05-24T15:29:47+00:00">When a song is downloaded, the item in the list doesn't cause an invalidate (so that it shows as green</del>)</li>
<li>Persistance, so that when you relaunch the application it will show songs previously downloaded</li>
<li>A nicer way to navigate to Popular, latest, users etc.. (perhaps even with a login?)</li>
<li>When multiple downloads are started, have a new window appear with a bunch of progress bars</li>
<li>The ability to play/stream the music directly through the application so you can test which songs you'd like to download</li>
<li> The ability to <3 songs </li>
</ol>
<p>Let me know if anyone would like it on GitHub as well.</p>
<blockquote><p>Anyone up for the challenge?</p></blockquote>
<h3> Forgotten README </h3>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t really include a manual so here is a quick one.<br />
<code><br />
~Welcome to my slapped together HypeMachine Batch Downloader Application~</p>
<p>1. Choosing the location to download from:<br />
You can change the URL in the top right text field. Simply change &lsquo;popular&rsquo; to things such as &lsquo;latest&rsquo; or even any username!</p>
<p>2. Choosing where to save the MP3 files.<br />
The button to the top right lets you chose the save location. By default it&rsquo;s where the application has launched from.</p>
<p>3. The 'More' button scrapes additional songs! (Thinking of just having it notice when you scroll to the end instead)</p>
<p>4. The 'Refresh' button restarts the page number 1 and refreshes the song listing.</p>
<p>5. The 'Download' button downloads. Simple!<br />
</code></p>
