  content: Ditto. Thanks for the update! The Firefox hypem download extension hasn't
    been working for a while (perhaps because of this same issue?), but it's great
    to at least be able to use Chrome.

    This is due to http://static-ak.hypem.net/rev_1345610552/js/hype_functions_min.js change line 115 =)

  content: Roger, I don't think that's really quite true.  Oh, he may not be saiyng
    it with proper reference to your blog post, but looking through his plan, there
    are a whole bunch of things that directly touch on your points.  Some of them,
    like the tax reorganization, just cut costs, but that would free more resources
    to pay for jobs, innovation, etc.  Others, like the reduction in regulations,
    would encourage innovation directly -- I know a lot of people who are in startups
    or who have run startups in the past who are finding additional financial regulation
    in particular  are making new startups much harder to start up.   The "Human Capital"
    part of the Romney plan specifically addresses retraining in a number of ways;
    I dont' see anything about teaching people specifically to be machinists and such,
    which we actually need, but retraining is specifically mentioned.In any case,
    the point is that I don't think it's factually correct to say  "that neither candidate
    for president in the United States has articulated a good, substantive answer
    to this question." unless you're using the word "substantial" in a fashion unfamiliar
    to me.

    reading material before going to bed every night. The other is our good friend
    chubby Tom Friedman.  (his chubbiness has nothing to do with anything but I just
    feel good saying it). The question is, at what point does the avid reader become
    the motivator for the author to write the kind of things he knows the avid reader
    wants to hear and thus continue to be his favourite? Is there any question that
    Obama wishes to lull us to sleep over Iran's nukes, because he has more or less
    resigned himself to a world with nukey Iran? Isn't his grand strategy about to
    shift focus from the Middle East to East Asia, anyway?

  content: For me, choosing a meadcil specialty is easy.  I was lucky enough to have
    the opportunity to work as a Dermatologist Tech prior to moving to Alaska.  What
    an amazing field!  No two cases are the same and more than one type of procedure
    can be performed in a day.  Working for a dermatologist provides the benefits
    of both a private office setting and hours along with the experience of surgeries
    and unique treatments.  Cyst removals and cancer treatments became the most interesting
    procedures to me and I can not wait to get back into the field!There are not many
    positions or specialties I would turn down when it comes to the meadcil field.  If
    I had to pick one, however, it would have to be gynecology.  Why would this be
    the field I turn down?  I am honestly not sure.  I must be lacking the gene the
    would cause me to be interested in the subject!  For whatever reason I would choose
    to work anywhere else before choosing gynecology.  Specialty clinics are like
    sushi I guess.  How do you know you don't like it if you've never tried it?!

  content: If government is not the anewsr, we should not expect politicians to have
    the anewsrs. Recognizing this, government must get out of the way. The natural
    gas revolution came about without government. Productivity improvements from automation,
    technology, and process innovation do not rely on government. Removing tax, regulatory,
    subsidy, and other economic distortions because of government is what we need.
    Innovation and entrepreneurship come from creative minds and courageous investments,
    both of which depend on liberty. Without liberty, why bother?

  content: Anybody who reads this blog remember HUAC? McCarthy?The prolbem for me
    is that Bush/Cheney have gone a long way toward establishing a throne in the Oval
    Office and we as a people need to work hard toward getting our leaders to put
    some restraints on the president, whoever he is.Also, one of the things I've always
    disliked intensely, if not despised, about the Bushes is that they are such mean
    campaigners, not hesitating to use race baiting and character assassination. For
    some reason, though, that doesn't seem to be working out so well for McCain. Much
    of what is going on in the McCain campaign seems to be born of desperation. I
    wish I could say this is the end of  politics of personal destruction  but somehow
    I doubt it.

  content: he is a Democrat.Perhaps reality is hinittg them in the face  .. As Gov.
    Richardson said of the Clintons, they are just trying to cling to the throne,
    and it is looking smaller and smaller as it gets further away.

  content: Roger, I don't think that's really quite true.  Oh, he may not be<a href="http://bnbuivvkdxp.com"
    rel="nofollow"> syiang</a> it with proper reference to your blog post, but looking
    through his plan, there are a whole bunch of things that directly touch on your
    points.  Some of them, like the tax reorganization, just cut costs, but that would
    free more resources to pay for jobs, innovation, etc.  Others, like the reduction
    in regulations, would encourage innovation directly -- I know a lot of people
    who are in startups or who have run startups in the past who are finding additional
    financial regulation in particular  are making new startups much harder to start
    up.   The "Human Capital" part of the Romney plan specifically addresses retraining
    in a number of ways; I dont' see anything about teaching people specifically to
    be machinists and such, which we actually need, but retraining is specifically
    mentioned.In any case, the point is that I don't think it's factually correct
    to say  "that neither candidate for president in the United States has articulated
    a good, substantive answer to this question." unless you're using the word "substantial"
    in a fashion unfamiliar to me.

<h2>Ninja Update</h2>
<p>
I haven't been using my <a href="https://github.com/fzakaria/HypeMachine-Extension">HypeMachine Extension</a> lately, which has caused me to fall behind in maintaining the extension. Someone had just e-mailed me recently regarding how the extension is no longer working.</p>
<blockquote><p>I should really integrate a settings option for the extension that points people to the GitHub EPR system.</p></blockquote>
<p>I've updated the Extension on my GitHub and you can follow these steps for installing the extension:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://github.com/fzakaria/HypeMachine-Extension/archives/master">Download</a> the extension.</li>
<li>Unzip the extension.</li>
<li>Go to your Chrome's Extension page: <a href="chrome://extensions">chrome://extensions</a>, and make sure the page is in Developer mode.</li>
<ul>
<li>If Developer mode has a + by it, click the + to add developer information to the page. The + changes to a -, and more buttons and information appear.</li>
</ul>
<li>Click the Load unpacked extension button. A file dialog appears</li>
<li>In the file dialog, navigate to your extension's folder and click OK.</li>
<li>Enjoy!</li>
</ol>
<p><!--more--></p>
<h2> For the curious </h2>
<p>
For those that are curious what had caused the extension to break, <a href="http://hypem.com/">HypeMachine</a> had changed from using <a href="http://www.prototypejs.org/">Prototype</a> and started using <a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery </a>instead.</p>
<p>
This change had caused all the instances of referring to Prototype's selector <strong><em>$$</em></strong> to no longer work. The hook into Prototype's Ajax responder was also rendered useless.</p>
<p>
I had decided to change the code to support Prototype rather than other options available, such as including myself the prototype.js file. This was done because I'm not sure if Prototype can still hook into Ajax requests done via jQuery. Once all the selector's and event handlers had been moved to jQuery, the extension worked again!</p>
<p><em>As an aside: <del datetime="2011-08-18T19:20:38+00:00">Sometimes</del> Very rarely the download arrows are not fully renered and I'm unsure why. If you know the reason and/or fix, please let me know. Here is an example:</em><br />
