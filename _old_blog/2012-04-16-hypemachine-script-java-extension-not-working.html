Hey Everyone,</p>
<p>First off, just wanted to <strong>thank everyone</strong> for all the kind words and support I've received either via the comments or by e-mail! It's always touching to hear about how a little program I wrote (in a hurry for my own use) has been so helpful for others. I think we all can agree how invaluable HypeMachine has been in expanding our music taste and it only makes sense to want to share that music offline at parties, in the form of playlists and at the gym for instance.</p>
<p>I've gotten a lot of feedback recently about how all the scripts, java program and extension have recently stopped working. I'm going to try and get it fixed A.S.A.P. however I'd like to point you all to my <a href="https://github.com/fzakaria">GitHub</a> where I've made all the code available. Please file a bug request or even fork the code! I kind of wrote all the code in a hurry for myself and it would be great to get some global community together to improve upon it! =)</p>
<p>I've set aside some time this week to look at it.</p>
<p>Cheers,<br />
Farid Zakaria</p>
