    If I comment out line 118, the script runs.

    Also, I get this error, so I don't think that "/" in the filename works either:
    ------
    generic exception: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'One Day / Reckoning Song (Wankelmut Remi....mp3'
    ------

    Sorry Farid, but I also found that the script doesn't respect the chosen download folder.

    It always downloads to the folder where the hypeme.py script is run from.

    Thanks again :)

    Hey Martin!

    I'll look into all these problems now for you! :)

    In the future I'd recommend opening up an 'Issue' on the gituhb page for the script here: https://github.com/fzakaria/HypeScript

    I'll respond back when I make the changes! :)

    I just pushed a change.

    I checked that 1) songs with forward slashes are working 2) filenames with accents (unicode) are working!

    Hey Farid

    Thanks, it works fine now :)

    One question, I have set the script to run automatically several times a day, and it scrapes my liked tracks.

    I have set the script to download 1 page only, but everytime it runs it has to download all the songs from page 1 and I have a clean-up script to remove the duplicates.

    There's no way to get around that, now that the sql database is gone (the script doesn't know which tracks it has already downloaded)?

    Hey!
    Um i've never pep8'd a python module before but ti's something I'd love to look into.
    There are a few to dos for the script as well. Thanks for the feedback!
    I actually have a huge re-design of the download site which I think everyone will love that I've done with a partner.

    Hey Martin,

    I initially removed the database checking to make the script simple for people to learn from.

    I can look into making it a proper module for you.

    I'm just a bit pre-occupied on my new site (http://metahypem.com).

    I will try and fix it up.
    If any of you are python wiz's I'd appreciate the help too! :)

<h2> I'm so slow </h2>
<p>
I'm been so caught up in my new website project (downloading songs from HypeMachine as well), that I've really left the extension and python script fall behind.<br />
In an attempt to try and rectify this, I've made the first step by fixing/updating the python script. I've already documented many of the changes that needed to occur in my <a href="http://blog.fzakaria.com/2012/10/hypem-api-changes/">previous</a> blog post but now here is the full source for those who are curious!</p>
<blockquote><p>You can download the script here: <a href="https://github.com/fzakaria/HypeScript">https://github.com/fzakaria/HypeScript</a></p></blockquote>
<p>
I've substantially cleaned up the code and removed the sqlite (database) aspect to it. This has resulted in a nice clean barebone downloader which does the one job it needs to do; <em>download'em songs!</em>. I'm always looking for advice, comments and feedback.</p>
