<h2> Proof of Concept </h2>
<p>
As an extension of learning Objective-C and Cocoa, I decided to dip my hands into iOS development. Excited to kick start the project given that I had spent 4.99$ on purchasing Xcode 4 (which is a great IDE), I started to build a 'proof of concept' <a href="http://hypem.com">HypeMachine</a> iPhone application. Expect more posts soon regarding the learning and understanding that had to be done in order to stream the music.</p>

<blockquote><p>Although future posts will explain the code (I plan on pushing it to GitHub. Work wouldn't be possible without code/explanation from Matt Gallagher and his <a href="http://cocoawithlove.com/2009/06/revisiting-old-post-streaming-and.html">great blog post</a> on the subject.</p></blockquote>
