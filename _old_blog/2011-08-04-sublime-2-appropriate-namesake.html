<h2>Sublime 2 </h2>
<p>
Browsing reddit in my usual fashion, I came acrossa post regarding text editors. Nothing new here I thought, posts such as these always seem to instantly turn into some <em>nerd battle</em> over Emacs and Vim. Strangely however was a comment (near the top even!) about a text editor called <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/2">Sublime 2</a>. Normally, I don't go downloading everything people recommend, especially software which don't include screen-shots.</p>
<blockquote><p>I find it annoying when developpers don't put screen-shots of their software. If you are trying to sell me a deliciously good looking user interface experience, you better sell it to me first via a picture so that I'll download it.</p></blockquote>

<h3> Key Features that Turn Me On </h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>The minimap.</strong> I didn't know how badly I wanted a minimap for software development until now!</li>
<li>Beautiful off the bad syntax highlighting and color scheme. Although obviously most editors you can setup the color scheme to mimic Sublime's, I enjoy having it done default right off the bat</li>
<li>Fullscreen and Distraction Free Mode really let you code without distraction.</li>
</ul>
