<h2> I want Django so bad </h2>
<p>
I have this constant need to learn and play with Django. To make matters worse, I have a similar need for Python, so it's quite the double whammy. It's actually quite annoying that I have no project to alleviate this pain... This is a call <strong>call out</strong> for anyone with a good webapp idea or who wants to partner up on a Django app!</p>
<h2> Who knew winning money was fun </h2>
<p>
Probably the most enjoyable gambling game I&rsquo;ve played has to be &lsquo;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craps">craps</a>&rsquo;. It is the game that is the most like when it is portrayed in films/tv (i.e. a giant table of people cheering and merry making). I feel however that when I play, I&rsquo;m guessing at my best moves and not making proper educated guesses.</p>
<blockquote><p>The house bet for craps can be as low as 0.02% at some points, making it the lowest advantage of all casino games.</p></blockquote>
<p>
I&rsquo;ve decided to put a little more effort into my craps game and sit down and learn the numbers. <em>No longer will I consistently ask the employees working the table how much should I bet to take advantage of my odds!</em> Hopefully this will let me at least play more craps enjoyably and perhaps even <del datetime="2012-08-17T18:39:17+00:00">lose less</del> win some money.</p>
<p>
Blackjack has never really been a game I&rsquo;ve enjoyed so this will fit swimmingly with me. I&rsquo;ve always had difficulty in probability as well and statistics; this should definitely also give a good refresher!</p>
<blockquote><p>Who knows, maybe this new hobby of mine will spark a new software idea (and I am in need of a good one)&hellip;</p></blockquote>
