<h2> Pushing Past Concept </h2>

Here's some more work on the application I did while at the airport today. There seems to be already a similar app for the Android App Store, <a href="http://www.appbrain.com/app/latest-hype/se.fmckl.latesthype">Latest Hype</a>. Their application actually looks pretty nice. I'm not really looking to develop this toy application to that level, just something I can stream music easier and download songs onto my iPhone potentially.</p>
