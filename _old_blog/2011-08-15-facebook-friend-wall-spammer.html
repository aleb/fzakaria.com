<h2> Finding usefulness out of annoyingness </h2>
<p>
My girlfriend has the habit of posting something on someone's wall and then immediately deleting her post for a variety of reasons. Recently she had done so to my own wall. What is interesting about deleted posts are that I still received a Facebook notification in the top left corner stating that she had posted something however clicking the item does <em>nothing</em>.</p>
<p>
If you've signed up for Facebook e-mail notifications however, you can track the notification down via the e-mail sent and it should contain a short summary of the post; allowing me to see the deleted content (<em>which seems kind of odd</em>). The whole process of deleting Facebook posts really seemed odd and as a result I wrote a quick <a href="http://www.blog.fzakaria.com/code/spammer/">web page</a> in order to try and play around with the functionality of deleting messages.</p>
<blockquote><p> You can find the web page here: <a href="http://www.blog.fzakaria.com/code/spammer/">http://www.blog.fzakaria.com/code/spammer/</a>. It should be self explanatory enough to use.</p></blockquote>

<h2> Things didn't work out as planned. </h2>
<p>
I had originally thought that I could write a Facebook Spammer that would immediately clean up and delete all the messages posted on someone's wall with the intention of the receiver having a <em>very large fake number</em> in their notification tray. This however did not turn out to be the case, as Facebook collects all recent activity per person and groups it under a <strong>single </strong>notification. With this option no longer possible, I'm sitting back and thinking what I can do with the following possibilities:</p>
<ul>
<li>I can spam multiple messages on a friend's wall.</li>
<li>I can delete the messages immediately written on a friend's wall.</li>
<li>I can give a <strong>single</strong> fake notification to a friend.</li>
<li>I can potentially send <em>secret</em> messages to friends via the e-mail notification system.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The last item on the list seems to intrigue me the most however I can't seem to think of a neat idea for it. I have the ability to tell someone I've sent them a secret message via Facebook that they can read via an e-mail notification, however I'm not sure how that can be any more useful than sending <em>an actual e-mail</em>. I'm going to sit on this for a bit and ponder, however in the mean time you can use the <a href="http://www.blog.fzakaria.com/code/spammer/">web page</a> to spam some friend's walls if you'd like.</p>
<p><em>DISCLAIMER: I'm not responsible if Facebook monitors spamming activity and they take any action. I'm sure if you keep it to something non-noticeable but still annoying (~20 posts) you're in the clean, but I'm not sure...</em></p>
