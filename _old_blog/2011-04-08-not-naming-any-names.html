    Rob -

    I think you meant:

    output = output*10 + (*a -&rsquo;0&prime;);

  content: ". HOWEVER, Woman B claimed she had never said anytihng to A about my wife
    spreading the rumors and that she was simply concerned about her. She was sorry,
    apologized, but understood if my wife didn't trust her as a friend. My wife was
    hurt, but choose to forgive woman B and move on and attempt to repair things with
    woman A.The next morning, woman B went to A and told her what my wife had done
    to her. Woman A was concerned about the accuracy of the information she was getting
    from B. Woman A asked her again if she was sure that what she had said at the
    party was true, including the party about my wife telling many different people
    and maliciously attempting to start the rumors. B said this was all true again,
    and that my wife was really upset with A and wanted to bring her down with what
    she said.A week later, my wife tried to talk to woman A to apologize for what
    was said. Woman A would not even look at my wife. She said she was done with her
    as a friend. She explained that woman B had come back to her to tell her she had
    been talking about her AGAIN, and she reiterated about the fact she had been spreading
    the rumors maliciously and my wife wanted to hurt woman A. None of this was true.
    Woman A called my wife a slew of fowl language in front of me, in front of dozens
    of her close friends and in front of many of my wife's friends. She stated that
    she was lying because woman B had said these things to her twice, and that she
    wouldn't lie.My wife is woman A's boss. Woman A is letting this effect her work.
    Woman A has cut off all communication with my wife outside of work. Woman B is
    now completely avoiding my wife entirely as well as woman B's husband, who is
    a close friend of mine.My wife forgave them both for what happened. Several weeks
    has passed. I have a hard time forgiving these people and wanted them to ever
    be back at our home. They were both very good friends of my wife's and now she
    feels alone and isolated because her two best friends destroyed their friendship.
    I even lost a close friend. The collateral damage goes very deep, since these
    were mutual friends of almost everyone we know.My wife wants me to move on, but
    I have such a hard time with that. My wife was trying to do the biblically accurate
    thing to hold a fellow sister in christ accountable and her other sister in christ;
    who was not a new christian, but a strong one, threw it in her face. She broke
    her trust not once, but twice.I just think she doesn't need to be friends with
    these people if this is how they treat their relationships. I don't feel comfortable
    having them around my home if this is what they choose to do.What do you think?"

<h2> He was told to write atoi </h2>
<p>
A good friend of mine from the University of Waterloo just send me a code snippet he had saved up. This is a very remarkable piece of code. The background to the code was that it was written during the operating systems course (Computer Engineering) and that one of his group members was asked to write an aoti function in C for the OS. Here's what he e-mailed back:</p>
<pre>
<code>
INT16 atoi_convert (CHAR * input)
{
    UINT16 output = 0 ;
    CHAR * a;
    while (a == "input++")
    {
      output = output*10 + (a -'0');
     return output ;
    }
    return output;
}
</code>
</pre>
<blockquote><p>It's impressive that it compiles.</p></blockquote>
<p>
Honestly, words can't describe the code above. I wish I could say that it is fake however the person who wrote this is now graduating with a degree in Computer Engineering from UW. Shows how far you can get by in life knowing nothing I guess.</p>
