    Hey Mitchell,

    The site should be running faster now.
    As per the issue you mentioned i tracked down the root cause and opened up an issue to myself.

    The fix shouldn't be that hard and I will look into it ASAP.

  content: "Hey there,\n\nYeah i've been having the same problem. Clicking download
    seems to have no response, until a few minutes later we get \"The webpage at http://metahypem.com/download/1s2qg
    might be temporarily down or it may have moved permanently to a new web address.\"
    \ - sad face.\n\nHowever, right clicking, &amp; save-link-as-ing is working fine.
    \n\nOther than this, this page is easily one of my favourite things on the internet."

    Hey Amy!

    I've definitely found the source of the problem.
    HypeMachine is eventually loading the tracks on soundcloud and having their old links be 'redirects'.
    I have to either expire the download URLs I have or follow the redirect.

    I will update it hopefully soon. Xmas time is busy though :)

    Glad you love it!

  content: "(I'm not sure if I'm posting this in the corcert place as I was unable
    to post it from the Dashboard.)The type of physician I would like to work with
    is a gerontologist.  A gerontologist specializes in caring for the elderly.  I
    have a fondness for our older population.  They built out society and lived in
    a time that many of us can learn from.  I would take great pride in caring for
    them as they age.  In my opinion, working with a doctor that shares my passion
    and excitement would be the ideal work environment.The type of physician I would
    not be as excited to work with would be a proctologist.  To be completely honest,
    I just don't think I have what it takes to be in that environment.  It's important
    to be professional in any medical environment.  I believe my sense of humor would
    not allow me to be as professional as I would need to be.  I would also prefer
    not to work with ophthalmologist.  Several years ago I spent a week with my grandfather
    at a specialist to have cataracts removed.  I found it very difficult to watch
    the videos of my grandfather's up coming procedures.  It wasn't difficult caring
    for my grandfather after surgery, but I must admit the pre-op was an experience
    that I would not want to assist in on a daily bases."

  content: 'that institution which posessses one or both (almost always both) of the
    following properties: (1) it acquires its income by the physical coercion known
    as &ldquo;taxation&rdquo;; and (2) it asserts and usually obtains a coerced monopoly
    of the provision of defense service (police and courts) over a given territorial
    area. An institution not possessing either of these properties is not and cannot
    be, in accordance with my definition, a state.Even if we all accept Rothbard&rsquo;s
    definition of the State, this does not change the discussion much. I don&rsquo;t
    think anyone denies that state functions of any kind depend upon these two attributes.
    You concede as much for at least coercion in the example you give in the prior
    post referring to the ancient Celtic Irish: Generally, disputes were settled through
    freely administered law (see Brehon Law) and those who chose not to play by the
    rules were ostracized. Do you not agree that ostracism is a form of coercion?
    Does it not follow that your own example of an ancient success story for anarchism
    (what happened, by the way?) employs the same coercion as that to which you object
    in the hands of the state? At least in this one of the two criteria, your precious
    Celtic Irish anarchists qualify as state actors.As to taxation, I do not know
    enough about Celtic Irish history to give a credible example, but I would be surprised
    if nothing of the kind ever existed, at least in concept. Again, it depends much
    on how you define &ldquo;tax&rdquo;, doesn&rsquo;t it?We are left, nonetheless,
    with the question of whether the establishment of coercion and monopoly of certain
    forms of defense are desirable, and/or superior to the anarchist position which
    claims such social institutions are unnecessary and undesirable. People, reasonable
    or not, as Brok has already said, do disagree over these questions. Unlike anarchists,
    however, I think people like Mr. Brok and myself at least, have learned much more
    about anarchism, than anarchists appear to know about the prevailing wisdom of
    constitutional law, common law, and the economics of law, as we know and experience
    it. I have repeatedly found that it is nearly impossible to refer to any attribute
    of these things without encountering denial of their legitimacy, if not complete
    ignorance of their details, even as a framework subject to debate.It is my view
    that one is better served by a deep understanding of that which he opposes, than
    to merely steep himself in the rhetoric of opposition. Here is how, in the same
    lecture, Rothbard describes anarchism: &ldquo;On the other hand, I define anarchist
    society as one where there is no legal possibility for coercive aggression against
    the person or property of an individual. Anarchists oppose the state because it
    has its very being in such aggression, namely, the expropriation of private property
    through taxation, the coercive exclusion of other providers of defense service
    from its territory, and all of the other depredations and coercions that are built
    upon these twin foci of invasions of individual rights.Please define &ldquo;legal
    possibility&rdquo;; &ldquo;coercive aggression&rdquo;; and &ldquo;invasions of
    individual rights&rdquo; and you will see what I mean. You must, I understand
    from countless other dialogues on this subject here, refer only to your own anarchist
    framework to define these terms. Therefore you assume your conclusion as a precondition
    for discussion.If I refer to the foundations of property, tort and contract law
    in terms of the common law meanings, and bridge those meanings to the concepts
    of self-government, which in fact possess the attributes which Rothbard defines,
    I see these as a positive development, not a terrible mistake that is the downfall
    of liberty and freedom. In that regard, I rather prefer the view of Mises, who
    described government of one of the greatest of human inventions.Yet Rothbard uses
    these terms to distinguish between his view of anarchism and his view of the State
    by allowing these terms to only be used within his own frame of reference, in
    which coercion and monopoly of force are presumed to be antithetical to the concept
    of liberty. I quite disagree.Those of us attempting to converse with you (meaning
    the Rothbardian anarchists who sadly make up the intellectual core at mises.com)
    from the &ldquo;outside&rdquo; cannot effectively do so, because you only allow
    your own frame of reference to apply meaning to common terms. This is why there
    has never been a constructive outcome, in my experience, from engaging in such
    a discussion here. Perhaps Mr. Brok has a new approach. I&rsquo;m listening.'

  content: The question about, who is the  true  asnichrat seems worthless.  Both  want
    to eliminate the use of force, but have different systems to do so. We can all
    agree that either system is better than the current. I say we can ignore our difference
    of minutes and worry about true philosophical differences.

<h2> Milestone Baby! </h2>
<blockquote><p><strong>Update</strong> Since posting (~1 month) we generated 30 000 songs. Awesome!</p></blockquote>
<p>
I've only told few people (not that many read my blog) about <a href="http://metahypem.com">Metahypem</a>, largely because it is still a huge WIP and a learning experience. Nevertheless, the few that have been checked it out seem to be using it quite extensively.<br />
I haven't managed to grep the logs yet to see some interesting statistics, however we've recently passed the milestone of <strong>over 10 000 songs liberated</strong>.</p>
<p>
That's a pretty awesome number! That many times someone wanted to hear a particular song while not at their computer or over an internet connection and we aided them in that! I'll follow up with some interesting tidbits from the request logs when I get a chance.<br />
Thanks <3</p>
