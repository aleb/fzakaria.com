    realised how ungrateful I've been by never stoping by to say thank you at least.
    \n\nSo, thank you! keep up the good work :)"

  content: Thank you, I've recently been sercahing for information about this subject
    for a long time and yours is the best I have came upon till now. But, what in
    regards to the bottom line? Are you positive concerning the source?|What i don't
    realize is actually how you are now not really a lot more smartly-favored than
    you may be right now. You are so intelligent.

  content: The basic question is  Can the enestprire provide the goods / services
    at a price that produces an acceptable return on investment (ROI)?  I don't mean
    to be political in the following, just practical. And in that vein even though
    he can't seem to articulate it, Romney knows bunches about job creation and ROI,
    as his involvement with Staples shows. What folks don't realize is that as a Staples
    goes into operation, it does kill loads of small business suppliers who cannot
    adapt. But its efficiencies ripple through the economy as its lower prices allow
    its business customers to spend the savings on other needs. A Staples also reduces
    the cost of its offerings to consumers in general, giving them greater choice
    and the pleasure of new products that they would not have otherwise purchased.
    (Readers may substitute some company other than Staples in the example.) The vast
    majority of small business startups take federal policy, regulation, and taxation
    as a given because they have no influence over those facets. They have to focus
    on the costs of doing business within the constraints and policies of state and
    local jurisdictions in starting their operations, whether it's a franchise or
    independent business.  Even established businesses will move and expand outside
    of their home base if business conditions -- ROI -- deteriorate .    While I don't
    know the specifics of the Alabama program for the Airbus manufacturing facility,
    I suspect the state is following the model South Carolina developed to capture
    BMW (Bubba Makes Wheels) in the early 1990s. SC minimizes hiring risk -- increasing
    the ROI potential -- by paying for and conducting all BMW training. If a candidate
    does not meet the standards or does not make the cut during the probationary period,
    the state bears the costs. SC restructured its technical colleges to focus on
    job-specific training for BMW through augmenting permanent staff with consultants
    / adjuncts / part-timers of all sorts to provide whatever training might be required.
    BMW assists by providing unique fixtures or equipment such as special purpose
    or proprietary robots to be used in the training. Details  (PDF). State policy
    has expanded the support technical colleges provide to include suppliers to BMW,
    Honda, and other suppliers to manufacturers.The jobs came indirectly from BMW's
    innovation in design and performance, but directly from its goal to increase ROI.
    They ended up in SC because they figured the odds were good. Note that the approach
    that Alabama and SC have taken bodes ill for unions to the extent that another
    party -- the state technical colleges -- has assumed responsibility for worker
    training and  certification.  As long as workers regard wages as adequate -- the
    average wage at BMW approaches $70K -- the opportunity for unions to organize
    the workforce remains dim. That's a feature, not a bug

  content: National Memory Screening DayFree, confidential meormy screenings for anyone
    concerned about meormy loss and early Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease detection and
    intervention, sponsored by Visiting Angels in cooperation with the Alzheimer&rsquo;s
    Foundation of America.WHEN:Tuesday November 13 2012Noon   4pmWHERE:Avalon Missionary
    Church.        1212 Lower Huntington Rd. Fort Wayne IN 46819INFO:National Memory
    Screening Day is an annual initiative of the Alzheimer&rsquo;s Foundation of America
    (AFA). Visiting Angels is proud to be a partner in this important first step in
    finding out if someone has a meormy problem, and in helping patients and families
    become aware of the resources and assistance that is available.While a meormy
    screening is not a substitute for a consultation with a physician, it can help
    to determine whether additional testing is warranted. With as many as 5.1 million
    Americans living with Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease, and many more with mild cognitive
    impairment and dementia, early detection and intervention can be critical to making
    informed decisions for greater health and quality of life.For more information
    on meormy screening and resources to assist with ageing in place, cognitive impairment,
    mild dementia, or Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease, contact Visiting Angels at 260-482-CARE
    (2273).

  content: Since there is so many fields of stpicaleies that I have a choice of, I
    still really can't choose one.  So I am going base on my personal experiences.  My
    original goal back in high school and maybe even before that, was to work in a
    Neonatal ICU!  I had a brother that passed before he had his first birthday from
    heart complications, and that year I spent a lot of time at hospitals with my
    parents.   My goal the first couple of years was to work with babies just like
    him.   That was until I had my own children,  I would of still loved to have worked
    in that career field but the heart ache I would most likely endure when one of
    those babies did not make it home.  I could not have handled!On to more positive
    experiences, I have worked with the elderly and Geriatrics interests me very much.  Being
    surrounded with people that have lived a fulfilled life is so much more rewarding.  Even
    though at times it is the ending stages of their lives,  and it is sad when someone
    does pass.  It's less of a heartache to know that most of the time they are ready
    to move on.   They are still very dependent on you and when you are able to help
    them with their needs that's the most rewarding of all, plus you form a special
    relationship with the patients and their families.

<h2>Minor improvements</h2>
<p>
Hasn't been a while since I've written a blog post and this one will be pretty short. I've recently submitted a small push to my <a href="https://github.com/fzakaria/HypeMachine-Extension">HypeMachine-Extension</a>. The commit includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>General code cleanlyness (so people can learn/understand better what it's doing)</li>
<li>Added Google Analytics to see how many songs are being downloaded in general.</li>
<li>Added download attribute so that the song automatically downloads when you click the button!</li>
</ul>
<p>I think the best reason to grab the latest changes is for the download on click fix, which also sets the name of the file download to the "title - artist.mp3"</p>
<h2> Open Questions </h2>
<h3> Ideas for Metrics? </h3>
<p>
I'd love to hear ideas on some neat Google Analytics people would like to see tracked. I'll be publishing the metrics I'm tracking now once I get enough data!</p>
<h3> Google Chrome Store ? </h3>
<p>
Does anyone know enough of copyright law/trademark infringement to help me understand whether I can safely re-publish the extension to the Google Chrome Store?</p>
