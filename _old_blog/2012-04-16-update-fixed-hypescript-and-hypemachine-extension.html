    Hi there,
    was wondering if you are still working on these things. The python script seems to be broken. There should be an issue with the number of pages. The script isn't able to process more pages than the first one.
    Do you have any idea how to fix it?

    Thanks for the time

Just a quick update. </p>
<p>I've fixed the HypeScript issue and updaed the HypeMachine Chrome extension. <em>Both should be working</em>, please let me know if they are still not.</p>
<p>For those curious as to the fixes they are:</p>
<p><strong>HypeScript</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Had to change the regular expression used to match the id/keys. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>HypeExtension</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Changed where the download button is appended to make it always properly visible and aesthetically pleasing still.</li>
</ul>
<p>
You can checkout my commits on GitHub and get the latest <a href="https://github.com/fzakaria/HypeMachine-Extension">extension</a> and <a href="https://github.com/fzakaria/HypeScript">hype script</a>. I'll try to update the java GUI batch downloader tonight (I need to re-setup the project again :S )</p>
<blockquote><p>Please let me know if you have any issues or need any help!</p></blockquote>
