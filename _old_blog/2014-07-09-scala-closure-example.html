<h2> Somewhat more real example </h2>
<p> Closures aren't new to me. I've used them a bunch when I've done JavaScript however I felt like the concept of a closure was really well defined/understood in JavaScript. Although I was aware you could likely (wasn't sure until I google'd) do it Scala, every example online <strong>infuriated</strong> me!<br />
Every example was pretty trivial (i.e. summing function) and used a global variable.<br />
I wanted to give a better example!</p>
<h2> Example </h2>
<pre class="brush:scala">
import org.joda.time.{DateTime,Period}

//We are inside some class or object
private def filterThoseCreatedBefore( time : DateTime) : (Model) => Boolean = {
  (model : Model)  =>  {
    model.createdAt.isBefore(time)
  }
}

val FILTER_CREATED_TWO_WEEKS_AGO = 
      filterThoseCreatedBefore(DateTime.now.minus(Period.weeks(2)))

val filteredTwoWeekList = models.filter(FILTER_CREATED_TWO_WEEKS_AGO(_))
</pre>
