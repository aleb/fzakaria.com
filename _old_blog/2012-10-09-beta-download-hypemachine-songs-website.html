  content: "Hey, thanks guy! This is awesome, I'm glad you provided a hosted version
    along with the source! \n\nSince this wasn't listed explicitly on your todo list:\n\nSongs
    that are no longer playable (mp3 file is gone) still show up in the list of downloadable
    songs, clicking download results in the following error: \n\"There's been an error.
    It's been reported to the site adminstrators via e-mail and should be fixed shortly.
    Thanks.\"\nThis is understandable, however, pressing the browsers back button
    causes you to go back to the app's main screen, (http://hypemfinder.fzakaria.com/)
    loosing your previous list of results. It would be nice to not have to click 'search'
    again after this happens.\n\nThanks!"

    Hey Amy!
    Thanks for the early feedback.

    I'm working right now on adding the ability to just search for songs as if youd search from HypeMachine and adding Soundcloud support!

    Hey morgan!

    I appreciate the feedback and I'm aware of both of those issues.

    I'm trying to figure out a  clean way to detect the songs not being there without just making a request myself to each one first -.-

    As for the back button, I don't have much experience with HTML5 but I'm hoping to learn to implement history to fix this solution.

    I'm also adding the ability to search as if in HypeMachine (with text) and adding SoundCloud support soon!

  content: "Awesome, Soundcloud support will definitely be a welcome addition!\n\nI
    also thought it might be nice and fairly trivial to add pagination support to
    hypemfinder. If you could somehow detect whether a link of results has more than
    one page, you can add pagination built in by simply adding a /{page#}/ to the
    end of results. This would eleminate the need of having to update the URL in the
    search box each page.\n\nFor example, http://hypem.com/captainmo\nand \nhttp://hypem.com/captainmo/2\n\nThanks!"

  content: "Hey Morgan,\n\nI'm not sure how trivial it will be to add pagination since
    when I get the songs from hypem I can't tell if there is more. \n\nI've been working
    on integrating into the search and still let people do straight up URLs to a track
    they want. \n\nI'm also pretty blocked on the design. Know anyone decent in CSS?\n\nI'll
    look more into the pagination."

  content: This is a challenging area for both left and right. On the left Keynes
    "broken wiodnw fallacy" confuses "activity" with "wealth creation", and ignores
    the problem that even if "stimulus" worked, because of production patterns the
    activity is "stimulated" in China. On the right, the reality is given the growth
    of technology the marginal contribution of unskilled labor is trending *below*
    the cost of living for a family.Moral hazard created by the "safety net", or the
    income gap growing because of the skills gap. Left, right, and center we have
    to answer not just "where do jobs come from" but where will the average person
    work when only specialists prosper.

  content: ".Jobs come from some enterprising iavddiiunl seeing an opportunity to
    create wealth and hiring people to take advantage of that opportunity.  The hiring
    decision is based on the expected bottom line of the person doing the hiring,
    be that a sole proprietor or a manager in some mega-corporation.  With the Obama
    administration churning out tens of thousands  new costly regulations it is little
    wonder that prospective employers are reluctant to hire when return on investment
    is both uncertain and likely to be negatively effected by regulations in the pipeline.."

  content: I am confused about how dmenad and internal economic variability fit into
    this argument. Certainly we didn't shed millions of jobs in 2008 because of a
    loss of effort, resources, or innovation. I suppose under your definition of wealth
    we could chalk it up to a loss of luck, but that doesn't seem too insightful.
    If weakening dmenad for goods and services amplified by some positive feedbacks
    can lead to a loss of millions of jobs, why does that not factor into our discussion
    of how we gain jobs?

<h2> Seriously. Beta </h2>
<blockquote><p>For those in a rush and want a <strong>tl;dr;</strong> navigate to<a href="http://hypemfinder.fzakaria.com"> http://hypemfinder.fzakaria.com</a></p></blockquote>
<p>
Hey everyone! I decided to throw up what I had so far for the site. It's working but a lot of functionality is missing however the most important part (downloading the songs) is extremely functional :)</p>
<p>
<strong>Instructions</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>First navigate to<a href="http://hypemfinder.fzakaria.com"> http://hypemfinder.fzakaria.com</a></li>
<li>Enter a <strong>valid</strong> hypem.com url (i.e. <em>http://hypem.com/popular</em> or <em>http://hypem.com/track/1qb1t</em>)</li>
<li>Click Search</li>
<li>It may take a few seconds (if searching a lot of songs), but the list of found songs will apear</li>
<li>Click the download button and enjoy!</li>
</ol>
<h2> Help, Feedback, Donations and Criticism Appreciated </h2>
<p>
This was honestly a test toy project to learn Django so don't expect too much however I'd love some user feedback on features, usability or even get a hold of me if you'd like to contribute!<br />
There's a few things left to still do to make it polished and I'd love some help with it.</p>
<h4>To do list</h4>
<ul>
<li><del datetime="2012-10-10T00:29:01+00:00">Figure out  URL scheme and remove the /hypemfinder/ app name at the end</del></li>
<li>Buy domain name (figure out domain name)</li>
<li>Figure out how to properly setup logging. Right now when I perform manage.py actions it creates a logfile that Apache cannot write to!</li>
<li>Add Contact/About/Tutorial page</li>
<li>Add detail page for songs</li>
<li>Add extended search functionality to make use of Hypem.com's search bar!</li>
<li>Cleanup CSS and make prettier</li>
</ul>
