<h2> The move to Nginx </h2>
<p>
It's been only one month on my new <a href="http://www.linode.com/?r=7527daf02578dcef070f8b8cbea9291a7bbdc553">Linode</a> machine and I've only ever known of Apache as a front end HTTP server. Apache sadly had to get the boot as I was preparing in deploying me and <a href="https://github.com/hortinstein">Alex Hortin's</a> new <a href="http://nodejs.org/">Node.JS</a> version of the site to facilitate downloading songs from <a href="http://hypem.com">HypeMachine</a>.</p>
<p>
Node.JS comes with a complete event-driven web server however I needed a front-end server so that I can host multiple sites on my single instance (such as this blog!). Having a blocking HTTP front-end such as Apache proxy requests to Node? <em>Sounds retarded.</em></p>
<p>
The whole appeal of Node.JS is that it's event-driven and non-blocking which hopefully results in really speedy responses. Luckily Nginx (pronounced EngineX) is also an event-driven web server and is a perfect match as a proxy server for a Node.JS application.</p>
<blockquote><p>
Apache is like Microsoft Word, it has a million options but you only need six. Nginx does those six things, and it does five of them 50 times faster than Apache. -- <em><a href="http://maisonbisson.com/blog/post/12249/chris-lea-on-nginx-and-wordpress/">Chris Lea</a></em>

<h3> Virtual Host Config </h3>
<p>
Here are the virtual host configs I've used for my blog. Setting up PHP fastCGI and wordpress was probably the most difficult aspect of Nginx but hopefully I've done it all correctly.<br />
If you have any suggestions or fixes please let me know!</p>
<h4> Wordpress </h4>
<p><strong>File /etc/nginx/sites-available/blog.domain.com</strong><br />
<code><br />
server {<br />
        #listen   80; ## listen for ipv4; this line is default and implied<br />
        #listen   [::]:80 default ipv6only=on; ## listen for ipv6</p>
<p>        root /home/user/public/blog.domain.com/public;<br />
        index index.html index.htm index.php;</p>
<p>        access_log /home/user/public/blog.domain.com/log/access.log;<br />
        error_log /home/user/public/blog.domain.com/log/error.log;<br />
        # Make site accessible from http://localhost/<br />

<p>        include global/wordpress.conf;<br />
        include global/restrictions.conf;<br />
}<br />
</code><br />
<strong>File /etc/nginx/global/restrictions.conf</strong><br />
<code><br />
# Global restrictions configuration file.<br />

<p># Deny all attempts to access hidden files such as .htaccess, .htpasswd, .DS_Store (Mac).<br />
# Keep logging the requests to parse later (or to pass to firewall utilities such as fail2ban)<br />
location ~ /. {<br />
        deny all;<br />
}</p>
<p># Deny access to any files with a .php extension in the uploads directory<br />

        # Comment the 'try_files' line out if you set up php-fpm/php-fcgi on another machine.  And then cross your fingers that you won't get hacked.<br />
        try_files $uri =404;</p>
<p>        fastcgi_split_path_info ^(.+.php)(/.+)$;<br />
        #NOTE: You should have "cgi.fix_pathinfo = 0;" in php.ini</p>

<h3> Special shoutout </h3>
<p>
I recently received a very nice donation from someone (you know who you are), and I just wanted to give a special shout out and say <strong>thanks</strong>. Getting donations such as yours is very heart warming and makes me feel like my time spent on some of these projects are well spent and appreciated. <3</p>
