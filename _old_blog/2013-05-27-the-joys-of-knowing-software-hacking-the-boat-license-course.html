  content: Hello, my name is Darby.  I'm a 7 year old weimaraner.  I'm using this
    new cotupmer for the first time today as my mom, Monica got a virus on the old
    pc.  There has been a lot of fussing going on as she usually uses a pc and this
    is a mac.  I hope she figures it out soon or this could be a very long semester.  This
    is Monica's third semester.  She took time off during the summer to go visit family
    in the lower 48 and enjoy the Alaska summer. We hiked almost every weekend.  I
    got good at chasing foxes, but would turn around as soon as they barked at me.  Due
    to government cut backs, Monica lost her job this week.  She is now determined
    more than ever to finish the medical/dental receptionist program then continue
    to medical coding and billing.  Her final goal is to become a geriatric nurse.  Monica
    has an eight year old daughter that snuggles up to read to me every night.  Dad
    is in the Air Force so we move a lot! Mom was so excited to find the online program
    at UAF so she can finish a degree no matter where we live.  Well, it's past my
    bed time and I'm sure someone's feet needs me to lay on them.  Good luck this
    semester and enjoy all the exciting stuff you get learn!!

    I started out to do this then saw that you had already done the work, so thanks :)

    I took your code and added one additional line which automatically clicks the "next" button, I just placed it in the success portion of the ajax call:

    document.getElementsByClassName("timer")[1].click();

<h2> Boat Licenses </h2>
<blockquote><p> NOTE: June 17th 2016 - I received a cease and desist letter from boat-ed.com and they have fixed the way in which the script in this post circumvents the wait. I am not aware of any other way to bypass it.</p></blockquote>
<p>
Summer is fast approaching and me and a group of friends decided to take the water on some <em>ridiculously fun jet skis</em>. In the state of Washington, a boat license <a href="http://www.boat-ed.com/wa/handbook/pwc.htm">is required</a> to operate any PWC (personal watercraft) which thankfully can be done online. As a procrastinator I put aside 30 minutes of my time the night before the excursion to do the online exam on <a href="http://www.boat-ed.com">www.boat-ed.com</a>. I was in for a large shock when I discovered that you had to sit through all the course material on the website prior to attempting the exam; average time for completion<em> 6-8 hours</em>.</p>
<h2> Time is precious </h2>
<p>
Time is precious. It's constantly fleeting and the last thing I wanted to do was sit through 6-8 hours of instructions that I knew and are largely common sense. The final exam should be indicative of whether you know the material or not, therefore it is not necessary to force people to sit through the course (all though you can Google the answers to the exam...). As my roomate decided to sit through the course material blindly hitting next when the button becomes available as he watched tv shows on Netflix, I decided to investigate if my knowledge of Computer Science can save me!</p>
<h2> Chrome Extensions FTW </h2>
<blockquote><p>tl;dr; Install this <a href=" https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/boat-license-time-extensi/jabekedhfnccpjpjlhlmgfikammmlggb">Chrome Extension</a>, which will enable you to skip <strong>any</strong> State Boat License course on <a href="http://www.boat-ed.com">www.boat-ed.com</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Having some prior experience to writing Chrome Extensions and knowing more than my fair share of web services, I was able to dig into their JavaScript source files and find how they were forcing the users to sit through the course material. I will leave future blog posts perhaps detailing how one might go about <em>"hacking"</em> websites to reverse engineer their web services and fiddle around with it, briefly the steps were:</p>
<ol>
<li>Reverse obfuscate their JavaScript</li>
<li>Find the offending timer code</li>
<li>Figure out how to diable the timer (was a server call</li>
<li>Fake the code in a Chrome Extension</li>
</ol>
