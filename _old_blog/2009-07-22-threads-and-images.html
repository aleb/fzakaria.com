<p>So trying to learn a bit about concurrent programming prior to my class next semester and thought a good way to learn would be to write a simple application. Kinda odd how simple apps seem to grow so quickly into something that is beyond my scope of knowledge.</p>
<p>I wanted to originally write a simple image manipulation tool, as I thought it would be neat to look into really basic manipulatoin and try and perform them on separate threads. I had initially thought of doing it somewhat similar to what I head learned in <a href="http://www.cs.uwaterloo.ca/~glabahn/cs370/index.html">CS370 </a> of breaking the image into smaller images and offloading the processing onto small threads. There seemed a pretty good class offered in the .NET framework for this sort of thing; <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.threading.threadpool.aspx">the threadpool class</a>.</p>
<p>However nothing turned out as I had expected and trying to use the threadPool class was nightmarish.  I think partially the reason may be is that I am not setting up the image object properly so that multiple threads can access it. I guess the two approaches were either:</p>
<ol>
<li>Manipulate the actual image file and refresh the component with the new image every time a thread is done executing</li>
<li>Manipulate the pixels that are actually being displayed.</li>
</ol>
<p>Either or it didn&rsquo;t seem to work.</p>
<h3> Scaling Back </h3>
<p>Decided to scale back my attempts and just decided to go for a 1 thread (backgroundworker) approach. I had succesffuly done grey scaling (which was neat to learn on how something so simple can actually be pretty intense if you want to make the greyscale perfect). I had chosen to use the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grayscale#Converting_color_to_grayscale">values </a>:</p>
<pre name = "code" class="brush: csharp;toolbar: false;">
private const RED_FACTOR = 0.299;
private const GREEN_FACTOR = 0.587
private const BLUE_FACTOR = 0.114
</pre>
<pre name = "code" class="c#:nocontrols">            
Color currPixelColor =originalImage.GetPixel(i, j);
double red = RED_FACTOR* currPixelColor.R;
double blue = BLUE_FACTOR * currPixelColor.B;
double green=GREEN_FACTOR*currPixelColor.G;
double grey = red + blue + green;
changedImage.setPixel(i , j , grey , grey , grey);
</pre>
<p>I then tried to put RGB sliders, however I seemed to have hit a wall in making the sliders feel really responsive. I guess I would appreciate help from anyone if they have any ideas on how to do it.<br />
