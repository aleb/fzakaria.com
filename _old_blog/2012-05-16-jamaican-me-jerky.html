<h2> Simple. Easy. Rustic. <del datetime="2012-05-16T15:18:05+00:00">Local </del></h2>
<p>
Glad to see the countless hours I've spent watching Gordon Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares on Netflix has not been a complete waste. It was almost shocking <em>(and funny)</em> how repetitive Gordon's advice was and how every restauranter would refuse to accept his advice and the cold hard truth; their business plan is failing.</p>
<blockquote><p>Start with great ingredients (local preferable). Keep it simple. Keep it fresh. Keep it rustic.</p></blockquote>
<p>With a tiny Gordon screaming continuous cuss words in the back of my mind, I set of to try and see if I can take his words to heart and improve upon my creation of dishes.</p>
<h2> Jamaican Jerk Sandwich </h2>
<p>
<em>Ingredients</em></p>
<ul>
<li> 1 Chicken breast.</li>
<li> 1 Red or Yellow Pepper (Mix preferable)</li>
<li> 1 Kaiser bun </li>
<li> 1 dollup of garlic & cucumber tzatziki - I enjoyed and used <a href="http://www.summerfresh.com/dipsDip.php?a=1&b=1">Summer Fresh's Tzatziki</a></li>
<li> Jamaican Jerk Sauce - I prefer either <a href="http://reviews.presidentschoice.ca/6584/F9352/reviews.htm">President's Choice Memories of Montego Bay</a> (<strong>SPICY</strong>) or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Grace-Jerk-BBQ-Sauce-16oz/dp/B002F4PDHE">Grace Jerk BBQ Sauce</a></li>
</ul>
<p><em>Directions</em></p>
<ol>
<li> Marinate the chicken breast and large wedges of peppers in the jerk sauce.</li>
<li> BBQ the pepper wedges (they should have a nice char) and the chicken.</li>
<li> Toast the kaiser bun.</li>
<li> Place the breast in the bun, topped with some pepper wedges.</li>
<li> Place a heaping dollup of tzatziki on it.</li>
<li> Enjoy. <em>Preferably with a beer.</em>
</ol>
<p><strong>Shit. I'm hungry now.</strong></p>
