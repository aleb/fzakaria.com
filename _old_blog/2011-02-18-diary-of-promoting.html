    Hello Ben,

    So, I doubt you are going receive this message, but there is no harm in writing it anyways. Even if it doesn't end up in your inbox, I still gather satisfaction from releasing these thoughts with the intention of you reading them.

    You were a horrible human being. Period. No questions or grey areas about that fact. As a young, naive, sheltered woman, truly entering the world for the first time, I could not have picked a worse creature for me to stumble upon. You were a verbally, psychologically, and emotionally abusive person. Undermining me, belittling me, playing emotional games with me, name calling, saying frightening things to me... you were a piece of shit person. No remorse existed when it came to you.

    I remember to this day all the seriously fucked up things you told me, things that you did or thought. If I knew anyone like that today, I would strive towards having them aided by psychotherapists. You are the type of person that I speak of as the "next columbine". I would not by shocked if I discovered that one day you were accused of disgusting or disturbing crimes. You fit the job description.

    I can only hope for a moment, as futile as it may be, that you got better. No one deserves to put up with you being the sick fuck you are. But you are not worth much more thought then that which I put down in this message.

    My primary reason for writing this is to let go of these thoughts in attempts to eliminate any guilt I may feel for not getting you help when I could. I think about all the seriously disturbing things you thought and did, and hope no one is harmed by you. As far as you personally are concerned, I would not care if you got hit by a truck. And that type of insensitivity I reserve for the scum of this planet.

    Mel

<h2> The Mission </h2>
<p>
So I've always thought of myself of being able to hold events; both which are popular and fun. I've held enough over the course of my undergraduate career at University of Waterloo that this term I was too exhausted to even setup a party for my own <em>birthday party</em>. However, I am now <del datetime="2011-02-18T15:37:11+00:00">well</del> somewhat rested and ready for my new challenge and goal!</p>
<p>
I have a great friend, <a href="http://www.facebook.com/FreaknBigPanda">Benjamin Luke</a>, who enjoys to spin Funky-House-Electro. Although he mainly plays for himself and the company of us his friends at small parties, myself and others have constantly pushed him to pursue gigs at small venues (mainly because it would be a <strong>bitching</strong> time for us).</p>
<p>
Anyways, I've taken it upon myself to try and now get him a new gig somewhere (he's obviously down for the proposition) so that we can have merriment and a great time. I've always been curious of promoting and PR relations and this is also going to prove an interesting concept to me to see how I can help my friend break through; if even in a minute way. Anyways, I plan on documenting (at least online) my attempt and we'll see what we both can learn.</p>
