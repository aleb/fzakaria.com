    I tried your terminal code but it gives me this error:

     "Cloning into 'HypeMachine-Extension'...
    Permission denied (publickey).
    fatal: Could not read from remote repository.
    Please make sure you have the correct access rights
    and the repository exists."

    Then I tried going to your GitHub and downloading the updated branch with the fix and replacing my old extension with it, but the same problem persists.

    Can you help me out with this? Am I doing something wrong? Seems like the fix is working for these other people.

    Robert, You need to setup your GitHub account with an ssh key, see https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys

    I am still having the same issue (random file names) on OSX , chrome  Version 35.0.1916.153, after loading the updated extension (still says version 1.44?). Yet to test on my windows machine..

    many people are finding it a great community as well as a code repository. The
    input, feedback and contributions being made to Jigoshop are amazing, and really
    help to max the benefits of going with an open source licence.August 26, 2011

    I tried it today at work.. some of the downloads worked and others didnt.
    Its a bit frustrating because its a Chrome issue and I'm not super well versed.
    I will try to investigate some more!

<h2>Wah Happened?!</h2>
<p>
During the last week I got a lot of e-mails from people telling me how the extension was no longer working for them. The complaint was the name of the song downloaded seemed to have been 'garbled' or no longer working. I'm sorry it took me a while (~1 week) to dig into it, however I now have published the fix into a new branch on Github.</p>
<pre class="bash">
#Run this from 'Terminal' on your mac for instance
git clone -b chrome-bug-373182 git@github.com:fzakaria/HypeMachine-Extension.git
</pre></p>
<p> For those curious, the regression (bug) looks to be caused by Chrome/Chromium and is currently being tracked <a href="https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=373182">here</a>, where they don't seem to be respecting the download attribute for anchor tags.</p>
<p>Enjoy the music,<br />
Farid</p>
