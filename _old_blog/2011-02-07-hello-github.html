<h2>Public Repositories, A New Frontier </h2>
<p>
So today marked the day, that I had started my first repository on GitHub! I got an e-mail from someone using my <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/imbbbpnnjeljfopnjohfoieconfedbhh">HypeMachine Chrome Extension</a> saying that he'd like to fix the bug that people are currently experiencing where navigating stops song playback. As I have limited experience in Javascript, this was wonderful news.</p>
<p>
Long story short, the HypeMachine extension is now on GitHub! You can clone and update it and contribute to the music hive-mind. I'm eagerly waiting the release of an API on Chrome for interacting with the download manager. Once that is released, work will begin on batch downloads! =)</p>
