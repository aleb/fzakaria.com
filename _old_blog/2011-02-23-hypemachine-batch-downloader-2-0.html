    !
    i have been looking for something like this for quite some time. thank you thank you thank you so much for taking the time to write it! i've been using your chrome extension for awhile now, but it takes awhile to drudge through all 65 pages and download them manually...

    one problem: it seems to be hanging on the third track. like, the first two downloaded fine, but it can't download the third...any idea why this would be happening? lemme know if you need me to send some logs or whatever; i'd love to help test this script for you if it means getting all these mp3s at last

    oh, but now i have a real bug: the python script exits if it hits a 404 on the mp3 file.
    this is the file it occurred on for me, if it helps: http://hypem.com/#!/item/199d8/

    know python but i thiiink i fixed it by wrapping the urllib2.urlopen in the download_song
    def with a try/except where the exception returns a false and prints a msg notifying
    of the 404"

    look into the script why it is causing that error. I think I had actually fixed
    that on my local machine but forgot to update the script on my website. I'll make
    sure to do that.\n\n\nI'm also working on a Mac application that performs the
    same functionality.\nIf you'd like and leave me you're e-mail I can send it to
    you when I'm done."

    hype machine now can somehow detect the use of the extension and makes the links playback "Rick Rolled" music instead.  See comments:

    Nice extension though.

  content: I completely undnrstaed this objection and I too suspect that greater knowledge
    of the Higgs will likely never bring us great technological advance (or at least,
    not in the near future). But I also suspect this is the wrong question to ask   that
    the benefits of pure science will in the future descend less directly from the
    science itself, but will still be inextricably linked to the research which bore
    it. Just as CERN brought us the web, and the space programme brought numerous
    technological spin-offs, I'm sure pure inspirational science of the future will
    reward us in ways we cannot now predict, but which stem directly from its pursuit
    (indeed, just as times of war always bring us medical advances). Apart from anything
    else, you can't bracket off different areas of physics, or even science as a whole,
    and treat them as isolated avenues of study   the different disciplines will always
    talk to each other and augment each other's development. Matt is right to note
    that this is a horse race in which you can't pick the winner before it starts,
    but the truth is bolder than that   whatever winners there are will emerge stronger
    from the participation of all the others.

  content: I am not sure what kind of practical teanlohogiccl advances can come out
    of studying the Higgs physics and the like, in the same way that the transistor
    came out of the discovery of the electron and quantum mechanics. The only reason
    I can see of for doing high-energy physics research is for the sake of plain curiosity
    and the fact that the state of understanding and technology allows for it.

  content: Just to play devil's advocate, isn't it safe to say that weahtver is discovered
    at the LHC and beyond will not have any practical effect until our everyday technology
    involves TeV scale energies?  Anything involving lower energies should be described
    just fine by the Standard Model.  In other words, doesn't the paradigm of effective
    field theory actually make high energy physics irrelevant to low energy everyday
    life?

<h2> They're going to hate me.. </h2>
<p>Going to keep this one short and <strong>sweet</strong>.</p>
<p>
So yesterday I decided to rewrite and fix the batch downloader script I had written in Python to download songs from <a href="http://hypem.com/">HypeMachine</a>. Anyways, you can find the find the new script and accompanying README file <a href=""><del datetime="2011-03-08T17:59:03+00:00">here</del></a> (or the Projects page). The script should be straight forward to setup and run. If you have any issues please let me know.
 </p>
<blockquote><p>EDIT: If you would like the script feel free to send me an e-mail. I removed the link from my blog upon request of the site creators of the website.</p></blockquote>
<h2> More to come </h2>
<p>
If there seems to be a demand, I might port it to some GUI form, to make it even simpler to get the songs. In the mean time I plan on fixing the HypeMachine chrome extension to allow browsing and playback at the same time. I also plan on porting the extension to Safari and Firefox.</p>
<blockquote><p>Enjoy the songs. =) </p></blockquote>
