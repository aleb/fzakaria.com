  content: the firefox extension downloadhelper allows downloading of ANY streaming
    content. It's probably far off for the answer you're looking for but it may be
    a more flexible batch download approach if you can figure out how that works.

<h2> The next task </h2>
<p>
I've been fiddling around with <a href="http://hypem.com">HypeMachine</a> for quite a while now even though my personal music taste has taken me elsewhere in search of music. Lately, I've been enjoying subscribing to individual artists on <a href="http://soundcloud.com">Soundcloud</a> as a way of finding more niche electronica.</p>
<p>
My experience so far with Soundcloud has been great. They even let you download <em>some</em> songs based on settings set by the artist! I however want the music while I'm on the go; especially on my jogs. I've now moved onto the task of seeing how I can liberate much of my beloved music from Soundcloud similarly to what I've accomplished with HypeMachine.</p>
<h2> Investigation </h2>
<p>
Once again most of the information gleamed was from saving the raw HTML of a request to SoundCloud outside the browser (i.e. via python or perl). They look to be doing something similar to HypeMachine in removing certain HTML elements because I cannot find them when I view source through my browser.</p>
<pre class="brush:javascript">
<script type="text/javascript">
window.SC.bufferTracks.push({"id":64568412,"uid":"WtquUHiysWgk","user":{"username":"diplo","permalink":"diplo"},"uri":"/diplo/got-stoned-and-mixed-really","duration":2162227,"token":"H7TPl","name":"got-stoned-and-mixed-really","title":"got stoned and mixed really old records for half an hour","commentable":true,"revealComments":true,"commentUri":"/diplo/got-stoned-and-mixed-really/comments/","streamUrl":"http://media.soundcloud.com/stream/WtquUHiysWgk?stream_token=H7TPl","waveformUrl":"http://w1.sndcdn.com/WtquUHiysWgk_m.png","propertiesUri":"/diplo/got-stoned-and-mixed-really/properties/","statusUri":"/transcodings/WtquUHiysWgk","replacingUid":null,"preprocessingReady":true,"renderingFailed":false,"isPublic":true,"geo":[],"commentableByUser":true,"favorite":false,"followingTrackOwner":false});
</script>
</pre>
<p>We can see one of the track elements is the streamURL:<br />
<code><br />
"streamUrl":"http://media.soundcloud.com/stream/WtquUHiysWgk?stream_token=H7TPl"<br />
</code></p>
<h2> Node.JS Style </h2>
<p>
Grabbing the bufferTracks variable can easily be accomplished in Node.JS with the help of the <a href="https://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom">jsdom</a>. I'd simply need to build the DOM according to the HTML file and access the JavaScript variable! I'm curious if there is even an easier way.... Drop a comment if you know of one!</p>
