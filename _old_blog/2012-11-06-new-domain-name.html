    Awesome job on the site, really amazing!

    Just wondering, on the previous set up I could search for my hypem userid, and it would show me my loved songs so I could download them. Is this still available? Or have you changed the search for artist names and song names, which is just as awesome by the way, I'm just curious. Great job on helping us out with this site

    hey! Just saw you're message!

    Yes I've switched the user functionality to the accounts page.
    I felt its a bit more natural.

    Please keep in mind this is very experiemental right now so you might have to go through the sign up process again as I'm modifying the database.

    I've left the signup process pretty easy though in the mean time :)

The site is redesigned in Node.JS and I will be providing some cool information regarding it in the near future. For now we have deployed the instance on a small server. Please don't murder our traffic :)</p>
