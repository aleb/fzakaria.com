    Hello!
    Really love your work. I use the hypem python script to download the popular page every couple days.. Couple questions.

    Any chance you can add the ability to use the ?sortby=fav anchor so that user could scrape by tags?

    And possibly a way to define the download location?

    Sorry, I am sure there are easy additions. I just dont know much about python at all.

    If not no worries! Keep up the good work. I would like to help with MetaHypem if you need any testers or anything!

    Hey Alex,
    should be easy to do. I'm, gonna keep that script in its simplicity (so other can learn) but maybe I'll write up a more robust one for things such as that!

<h2> Older work, still valid </h2>
<p>
A lot of people have been sending me e-mails due to the current state of <a href="http://metahypem.com">MetaHypem</a>. If you're looking to find alterative ways to download the music I can recommend the following.</p>
<ol>
<li>Just follow the blog link for each song. The blogs let you download the music.</li>
<li>
I've written previously a <a href="https://github.com/fzakaria/HypeMachine-Extension">Chrome Extension</a> that injects a download button into the web page.e web page.
<p> <em>Don't forget you need to right-click and select Save-As however...</em> </p>
</li>
<li>I wrote an example <a href="https://github.com/fzakaria/HypeScript">Python script</a> outlining how to download songs that you can use or help build other tools with.</li>
</ol>
