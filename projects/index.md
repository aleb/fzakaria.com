Through my undergraduate studies in Software Engineering at the University of Waterloo and pursuing interests on my own time I began/competed &nbsp;some interesting projects.

### Projects

#### [HypeMachine Chrome Extension](https://github.com/fzakaria/HypeMachine-Extension)

I was very much into the HypeMachine website for a while. It's a site that aggregates several popular indie music blogs so that you can easily stream & browse the music. The extension adds a download button next to all the songs.
I managed to reach around 10,000~ downloads from the Chrome extension store before [HypeMachine](http://hypem.com) asked me to take it down. I'm still maintaining it on my Github page and fixing it whenever they make changes to how they serve up their music.

> It was a delightful game of cat & mouse, as well as learning how to escape the Chrome sandbox.

#### [HypeMachine Python Script](https://github.com/fzakaria/HypeScript)


A python script that batch downloads songs from the [HypeMachine](http://hypem.com). Primarily written as a point of
reference to how it is possible to circumvent DRM for web-based players.

#### [Ray Tracer]()
The remnants & output of the ray tracer I had created for [CS488](http://www.student.cs.uwaterloo.ca/~cs488/). The raytracer is built upon the previous assignments in the course (however from scratch!) and the website goes onto to slightly explain how some of the features were implemented.

> I whole heartedly recommend the book [Fundamentals of Computer Graphics](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1482229390/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1482229390&linkCode=as2&tag=fzakaria-20&linkId=ef0da724225a5614935c7892581cce7f)
