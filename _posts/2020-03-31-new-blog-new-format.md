Hello World.

I've moved my blog from "Small Thoughts" [blog.fzakaria.com](http://blog.fzakaria.com), which was hosted on Wordpress & S3, one using Jekyll via Github Pages.

Why Github Pages and not S3 still? I wanted to see what all the fuss was about & it sounded simpler to set up the TLS certificates.

You may notice that the theme of this blog is **very** similar to that
of [Drew Devault's](https://drewdevault.com/); in fact, it is based on his published theme.

I admired on his blog his [campaign](https://drewdevault.com/make-a-blog) to get others blogging that I revived my forgotten blog. I enjoyed the minimalism of his blog and embraced it. The site uses very minimal _fancy_ Jekyll plugins, and you can find the source [here](https://github.com/fzakaria/fzakaria.com).

I'm still a novice to Jekyll & blogging in general; feel empowered to reach out to teach me or discuss.
