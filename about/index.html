<h2> Me </h2>
<p>I'm Farid Zakaria and I am a <a href="http://www.softeng.uwaterloo.ca/">Software Engineer</a> graduate from the University of Waterloo. University of Waterloo is unique in that they provide a co-op/intern experience in 4 month intervals all year round (6 internships in total ~ 2 years); which had given me some interesting early insight into the software industry even before graduating!</p>
<p> Since then I've gone to work for AMD developing multimedia drivers for Windows 8 and now on to Amazon to do who knows what! </p>
<p>This is a blog I mainly started to keep track of things I'm doing for myself during my internships and post graduate projects. It has grown a bit more to encompass broad <em>things </em>related to my life as well. I like to read/learn/write about software, however if you read this blog at all you'll notice that is not always the focal point.</p>
<p>If you would like to contact me, please send me an <a href="mailto:farid.m.zakaria@gmail.com" target="_blank">an e-mail </a>. I appreciate any feedback. I'm aware of the bountiful spelling mistakes on my blog though.</p>
